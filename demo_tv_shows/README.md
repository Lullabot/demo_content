#Demo TV Show Content

Enable this module, then created content by doing the following the command line:

```
cd path/to/module
sh create_content.sh
```

This shell script will use Devel Generate to create lorem ipsum content, then pull up
that content and update it so shows, seasons, and episodes are related to each other,
season and episode numbers are in order, and season and episode numbers are reflected in the titles.
